        <p>Amzzz - I remember this like it was yesterday...<br><br>
Simple Engine is an engine that allows you to mod Friday Night Funkin in a super simple way. The engine went through several stages, which were all very disgusting, but, over time, its development increased incredibly. Many members, who unfortunately no longer work on the project, are unaware of this new phase. I want to especially thank "MrNiz" and "AssManBruh!" for their unique and unparalleled contributions.
